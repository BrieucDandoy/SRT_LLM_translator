1
00:00:04,851 --> 00:00:07,360

Go, Pietrino!
2
00:00:07,707 --> 00:00:09,003

It's your turn!
3
00:01:06,822 --> 00:01:08,953

Let me through!
Let me through!
4
00:01:10,592 --> 00:01:13,785
- Pietro! Pietro!
- Does anyone have a car?
5
00:01:34,903 --> 00:01:37,493
I'm sorry, madam;
you can't enter now.
6
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:53,880
<i>The Goal of the Kingfisher</i>
7
00:02:36,899 --> 00:02:39,744

<i>Dear Dad, something
extraordinary happened to me.</i>
8
00:02:40,666 --> 00:02:42,825
<i>During the match
against Astra, I died.</i>
9
00:02:43,095 --> 00:02:45,092
<i>I didn't exactly die,
but I nearly did.</i>
10
00:02:45,192 --> 00:02:46,929
<i>They even took me
to the hospital.</i>
11
00:02:47,573 --> 00:02:50,344
<i>Since you passed away,
something strange has got into me.</i>
12
00:02:50,455 --> 00:02:52,843
<i>A sort of fear.
A mental block.</i>
13
00:02:53,194 --> 00:02:55,796
<i>The first time it happened to me
was during practice.</i>
14
00:02:56,367 --> 00:02:59,371
<i>I told the coach,
but he wouldn't believe me.</i>
15
00:03:03,278 --> 00:03:06,541
See? That's how you shoot a penalty!
Come on, go home!
16
00:03:09,314 --> 00:03:09,992
Go!
17
00:03:10,147 --> 00:03:11,137

Coach...
18
00:03:11,357 --> 00:03:12,525

What is it?
19
00:03:12,842 --> 00:03:14,017

Listen...
20
00:03:14,342 --> 00:03:17,899

I think you'd better choose
someone else to shoot penalties.
21
00:03:17,999 --> 00:03:19,056
Because...
22
00:03:19,213 --> 00:03:20,302

I feel...
23
00:03:20,782 --> 00:03:23,614

- I feel something strange.
- What do you feel?
24
00:03:24,302 --> 00:03:25,699
I don't know...
25
00:03:26,366 --> 00:03:27,533

I feel...
26
00:03:28,096 --> 00:03:29,315

"blocked".
27
00:03:30,205 --> 00:03:31,298

"Blocked"?!
28
00:03:31,514 --> 00:03:34,014

Come on, Moretti!
You have good feet!
29
00:03:34,453 --> 00:03:35,331
Go, go.
30
00:03:35,564 --> 00:03:38,096

Go and take a shower
with the others.
31
00:03:45,561 --> 00:03:50,382
<i>I couldn't tell Mom because, as you know,
she's not happy with me playing football.</i>
32
00:03:51,238 --> 00:03:52,673
You're all wet!
33
00:03:53,852 --> 00:03:55,016

Cover up.
34
00:03:57,721 --> 00:03:59,794

Why are you all wet
like this?
35
00:03:59,894 --> 00:04:02,891
<i>Besides, she's always
overprotective with me.</i>
36
00:04:12,702 --> 00:04:16,203
<i>I'm doing quite well at school,
but time passes slowly.</i>
37
00:04:16,481 --> 00:04:19,737
<i>By the way, do you remember
Giuliano, the repeating student,</i>
38
00:04:19,837 --> 00:04:21,601
<i>who is the goalie for Astra?</i>
39
00:04:21,701 --> 00:04:23,825

<i>He's still flirting
with Simonetta.</i>
40
00:04:23,925 --> 00:04:26,100
<i>But I think she's in love
with another boy.</i>
41
00:04:26,681 --> 00:04:29,597
<i>So he picks on me.
I've never made fun of him,</i>
42
00:04:29,697 --> 00:04:32,036
<i>yet he keeps playing
stupid tricks on me.</i>
43
00:04:33,191 --> 00:04:36,866
<i>Maybe it bothers him that
I'm the top scorer in the team.</i>
44
00:04:37,816 --> 00:04:39,027
- Hi.
- Hi...
45
00:04:39,215 --> 00:04:41,300
Relax!
The boss hasn't arrived yet.
46
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:43,765
- Are you sure?
- Yes, I'm sure.
47
00:04:44,027 --> 00:04:46,017
Hey, by the way...
48
00:04:46,355 --> 00:04:49,153

That German, who called
yesterday, is here again.
49
00:04:49,977 --> 00:04:51,838
The usher said he's been
here since 7:00.
50
00:04:52,434 --> 00:04:56,206
I take pictures of migratory birds.
Why did you seize my photo hides?
51
00:04:56,306 --> 00:04:57,433
I don't understand.
52
00:04:57,955 --> 00:05:00,976

They are ecological and
don't pollute the landscape.
53
00:05:01,076 --> 00:05:03,917
If you don't apply for a permit,
how are we supposed to know?
54
00:05:04,017 --> 00:05:06,693
Do you know how many people
would like a villa in the oasis?
55
00:05:06,793 --> 00:05:11,936
It's written here: "...after submitting
a permit request to the Water Authority".
56
00:05:13,095 --> 00:05:14,288
"Submitting"?
57
00:05:15,087 --> 00:05:19,372

It means "presenting". You need to
present a permit request on plain paper.
58
00:05:19,809 --> 00:05:22,593
- Do you want me to do that
for you? - Yes, please.
59
00:05:25,385 --> 00:05:27,732
<i>Dad, I'm embarrassed
to say this,</i>
60
00:05:27,874 --> 00:05:32,239
<i>but to overcome the fear that has got
into me, I made a bet with Jesus.</i>
61
00:05:32,967 --> 00:05:36,957
<i>I bet that if I managed to score
at least one goal against Astra,</i>
62
00:05:37,057 --> 00:05:42,080
<i>I'd find you at home, sitting at the table
with Mom, and we'd talk about the match.</i>
63
00:05:44,342 --> 00:05:46,823
<i>But you'll never sit
at the table with us again.</i>
64
00:05:49,048 --> 00:05:51,308
<i>I think about you, Dad,
all the time,</i>
65
00:05:51,546 --> 00:05:53,692
<i>even when I'm playing
football.</i>
66
00:05:53,839 --> 00:05:55,502
<i>Mom feels so bad...</i>
67
00:05:55,670 --> 00:06:00,031

<i>Sometimes she looks far away, as if
she were looking for you among a crowd.</i>
68
00:06:00,173 --> 00:06:03,201
<i>I wish I could help her,
but I can only do so much.</i>
69
00:06:03,301 --> 00:06:07,624
<i>Sometimes we both feel like crying,
but then we pretend nothing's happened.</i>
70
00:06:07,724 --> 00:06:10,397
<i>Now I'll tell you
how things turned out.</i>
71
00:06:12,186 --> 00:06:16,106
- I thought this morning would never end.
- You're telling me!
72
00:06:16,576 --> 00:06:20,255
- Where do we go for lunch?
To that fatso's? - No, the boss is going there;
73
00:06:20,355 --> 00:06:22,681
- we'd have to have lunch with him.
- Don't worry;
74
00:06:22,781 --> 00:06:24,992
he was on a long call
with the mayor.
75
00:06:25,092 --> 00:06:28,981
Hey, that German is really
a handsome guy, you know?
76
00:06:29,289 --> 00:06:31,067
You can have him.
He's all yours.
77
00:06:31,167 --> 00:06:33,451
- Really? I'll take him, then!
- Take him!
78
00:06:34,908 --> 00:06:36,223
Do you want to check?
79
00:06:37,831 --> 00:06:39,061

Please...
80
00:06:40,074 --> 00:06:41,669

Just wood and reeds.
81
00:06:42,778 --> 00:06:45,691

- No paint. No nails.
- Ah.
82
00:06:46,114 --> 00:06:48,574
- Beautiful.
- Yes, wonderful!
83
00:06:49,062 --> 00:06:51,963
And this is the hole
for the telephoto lens.
84
00:06:52,063 --> 00:06:54,743
You should come
and see, someday.
85
00:06:55,628 --> 00:06:56,886
With your friend.
86
00:06:56,986 --> 00:06:58,665

- We will.
- Yes, we will.
87
00:06:59,502 --> 00:07:02,429
- There he is!
- Ah! That's Missiroli.
88
00:07:02,529 --> 00:07:04,433
He's our boss.
We have to go now.
89
00:07:04,862 --> 00:07:07,160
- Bye. - <i>Auf Wiedersehen!</i>
- <i>Auf Wiedersehen!</i>
90
00:07:11,526 --> 00:07:12,722
<i>Herr</i> Missiroli...
91
00:07:12,822 --> 00:07:15,000

Oh, Jesus...
What can I do for you?
92
00:07:15,629 --> 00:07:17,564
Buffetti: number 4.
93
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:20,174

Cacciatori: number 5.
94
00:07:21,826 --> 00:07:23,770

Pavarotti: number 6.
95
00:07:26,851 --> 00:07:28,551

Trillini: number 9.
96
00:07:30,290 --> 00:07:32,034

New glasses again?
97
00:07:32,134 --> 00:07:35,052

It's already the 4th pair since
the start of the championship.
98
00:07:35,152 --> 00:07:38,571
- What does your father say?
- That I should avoid headers.
99
00:07:38,671 --> 00:07:42,435
- Coach, will Mottola play with
the number 7 jersey? - Number 11.
100
00:07:44,170 --> 00:07:46,950
- That handsome German has
his eye on you. - Come on!
101
00:07:47,050 --> 00:07:50,330
You know I have other things on my mind.
Besides, I don't like him.
102
00:07:50,430 --> 00:07:53,842
- He has the eyes of a madman.
- He has some healthy shoulders, though!
103
00:07:53,942 --> 00:07:55,445
Here I am!
104
00:07:56,398 --> 00:07:58,463

The "martinet" has arrived!
105
00:07:58,971 --> 00:08:00,204

May I take it?
106
00:08:00,353 --> 00:08:02,091

So, how's it going?
107
00:08:02,856 --> 00:08:04,527

What have you ordered?
108
00:08:04,841 --> 00:08:06,954

Two tuna and tomato
sandwiches.
109
00:08:07,054 --> 00:08:09,011
Tuna?
Canned food... Yuck!
110
00:08:09,322 --> 00:08:13,391
It's full of preservatives.
No, I need natural food. Hey, waiter!
111
00:08:13,638 --> 00:08:15,208
I've been waiting for an hour.
112
00:08:15,308 --> 00:08:18,954

For me, a <i>frittata</i> sandwich,
spread with mayonnaise.
113
00:08:19,097 --> 00:08:20,496
How disgusting!
114
00:08:21,285 --> 00:08:23,480

I was detained by that German.
115
00:08:23,580 --> 00:08:26,504

He's such a pain!
With his hides made of branches,
116
00:08:26,604 --> 00:08:28,931
he was driving me crazy,
last year.
117
00:08:29,031 --> 00:08:33,224
He got reported because he hadn't asked for
a permit. And he didn't understand a word.
118
00:08:33,271 --> 00:08:36,539
- He looks harmless to me.
- Yes, he looks so defenceless.
119
00:08:36,639 --> 00:08:40,268
"Defenceless"? You've never seen him
when he sets his mind on something!
120
00:08:40,368 --> 00:08:43,221
This is the last match
of the first half of the season.
121
00:08:44,099 --> 00:08:46,925
We're last to second
in the table, with 7 points.
122
00:08:47,025 --> 00:08:49,972
38 goals conceded,
8 goals scored.
123
00:08:50,282 --> 00:08:54,696
Guys, the second half of the season
is a whole another thing!
124
00:08:54,986 --> 00:08:59,442
You have to listen to me! We suck
because you always do things your way!
125
00:08:59,805 --> 00:09:00,688
Blackboard!
126
00:09:03,138 --> 00:09:06,124

Baracchi, you'll play
in midfield, okay?
127
00:09:06,710 --> 00:09:07,679
In coverage.
128
00:09:07,983 --> 00:09:10,959

You'll man-mark their Number 8.
If you block him,
129
00:09:11,173 --> 00:09:13,741
their manoeuvre will be
neutralized!
130
00:09:13,841 --> 00:09:18,233
Astra is first in the table, but it's not
necessarily bound to win every time!
131
00:09:18,585 --> 00:09:21,693
The point is that
you're embarrassing me at work,
132
00:09:21,793 --> 00:09:24,811
with all your absences
and lateness...
133
00:09:26,017 --> 00:09:28,866
Why don't you let me help you?
134
00:09:29,416 --> 00:09:30,331

Huh?
135
00:09:30,895 --> 00:09:33,026

We could go out
together sometime.
136
00:09:33,154 --> 00:09:35,192
You can bring your son, too.
137
00:09:35,854 --> 00:09:40,446

Pietro isn't well. He still hasn't
got over his father's death.
138
00:09:41,357 --> 00:09:43,530
I know he'd need a...
139
00:09:45,812 --> 00:09:49,804

I don't feel like going out, at the moment.
Thanks so much anyway.
140
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:54,310
But... can I come and
see him play next Saturday?
141
00:09:56,596 --> 00:09:57,269
Yes.
142
00:09:57,369 --> 00:10:00,641

I'll come for you, then!
We'll all go there by bike!
143
00:10:00,696 --> 00:10:02,218
See you on Saturday!
Bye!
144
00:10:04,460 --> 00:10:06,713
Every Saturday,
the same story.
145
00:10:06,876 --> 00:10:08,226
I'm not hungry.
146
00:10:09,211 --> 00:10:12,103

A match shouldn't cause you
so much tension.
147
00:10:12,637 --> 00:10:14,375
You don't understand.
148
00:10:15,550 --> 00:10:17,375

What don't I understand?
149
00:10:19,477 --> 00:10:23,321

It's not mandatory for you to play.
You can do something else.
150
00:10:24,367 --> 00:10:26,893
You don't play.
You can't understand.

170
00:11:43,287 --> 00:11:44,092

<i>Go!</i>
171
00:11:45,186 --> 00:11:46,839

You imbecile!
Imbecile!
172
00:11:48,343 --> 00:11:50,092
You suck!
173
00:11:55,197 --> 00:11:58,540

Hey! Are we playing
in their favour?!
174
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:02,407
Go for it!
175
00:12:04,835 --> 00:12:05,656

<i>Go!</i>
176
00:12:13,032 --> 00:12:17,512

You have to win, even at the cost
of leaving your lungs on the ground!
177
00:12:28,682 --> 00:12:29,584
<i>Come on!</i>
178
00:12:29,684 --> 00:12:32,180

- <i>Audace! Audace!</i>
- <i>Come on!</i>
179
00:12:34,603 --> 00:12:36,082
Hey, stay away from me!
180
00:12:54,519 --> 00:12:56,628

Francesca, look who's coming!
181
00:13:01,190 --> 00:13:02,748

The German is coming!
182
00:13:02,848 --> 00:13:05,380

Pietro is wasted in that team!
183
00:13:06,335 --> 00:13:07,204

<i>Come on!</i>
184
00:13:09,568 --> 00:13:11,235

- <i>Go!</i>
- <i>Go!</i>
185
00:13:13,283 --> 00:13:14,306
Pass the ball!
186
00:13:14,823 --> 00:13:15,903

<i>Triangle!</i>
187
00:13:16,208 --> 00:13:17,439

Trian...
Ouch!
188
00:13:17,659 --> 00:13:18,870
<i>Triangle!</i>
189
00:13:24,178 --> 00:13:25,044

<i>Go!</i>
190
00:13:26,932 --> 00:13:27,565

<i>Go!</i>
191
00:13:29,897 --> 00:13:33,956

Ref, don't you see it's offside?
Put some glasses on!
192
00:13:34,056 --> 00:13:35,210
It's not offside!
193
00:13:35,988 --> 00:13:40,956

(indistinct shouting)
194
00:13:41,837 --> 00:13:43,474

(indistinct shouting)
195
00:13:43,666 --> 00:13:44,724

<i>Go home!</i>
196
00:13:46,881 --> 00:13:50,177

- Lucky fatso!
- Who are you calling "fatso"?
197
00:13:54,221 --> 00:13:55,310
Guys...
198
00:13:56,254 --> 00:13:58,427

- Calm down! Calm down!
- <i>Out! Out!</i>
199
00:14:02,653 --> 00:14:04,652
- <i>Go!</i>
- <i>Come on!</i>
200
00:14:07,788 --> 00:14:09,105
Go for it!
201
00:14:10,201 --> 00:14:11,093

<i>Go!</i>
202
00:14:13,059 --> 00:14:13,989

<i>Go!</i>
203
00:14:15,534 --> 00:14:17,145

<i>Goal!</i>
204
00:14:17,245 --> 00:14:18,214

Yes!
205
00:14:18,314 --> 00:14:20,032

Hooray!
Hooray!
206
00:14:20,768 --> 00:14:21,933
Well done, Davide!
207
00:14:22,168 --> 00:14:26,699

Now we're starting to play seriously.
Let's score another goal right away.
208
00:14:27,083 --> 00:14:28,637
<i>Come on, keep it up!</i>
209
00:14:47,297 --> 00:14:47,916

Good!
210
00:14:48,359 --> 00:14:49,403

Ref!
211
00:14:50,838 --> 00:14:51,674

Huh?
212
00:14:57,865 --> 00:14:58,705

Penalty!
213
00:15:00,919 --> 00:15:01,954

Penalty!
214
00:15:02,313 --> 00:15:04,275

- What happened?
- Penalty...
215
00:15:04,956 --> 00:15:06,824
Ref, he hit the ball!
216
00:15:08,117 --> 00:15:09,241

Damn!
217
00:15:09,446 --> 00:15:13,531

I bet this time we're going to draw
with the team that is first in the table!
218
00:15:24,123 --> 00:15:25,794
He's going to score!
219
00:15:28,304 --> 00:15:29,587

Hey, little shit...
220
00:15:31,944 --> 00:15:32,893

Hello!
221
00:15:42,296 --> 00:15:43,768

You're not going to score.
222
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:47,140

<i>Wrong-foot him with a strike
into the left corner!</i>
223
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:49,111
<i>Get out of the box, guys.</i>
224
00:15:51,684 --> 00:15:54,125

Go, Pietrino!
225
00:15:54,553 --> 00:15:55,896

It's your turn!
226
00:16:31,460 --> 00:16:32,606

Oh, Christ...
227
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:46,988

Pietro!
Pietro!
228
00:16:47,157 --> 00:16:49,072
Oh, my God!
Pietro!
229
00:16:49,172 --> 00:16:50,394
Is he dead?
230
00:16:50,494 --> 00:16:51,603

Oh, my God!
231
00:16:53,751 --> 00:16:54,889

Gosh...
232
00:17:04,008 --> 00:17:05,509

So, did it go in?
233
00:17:05,772 --> 00:17:08,319

- "It"... what, darling?
- The penalty shot.
234
00:17:10,714 --> 00:17:12,892
I get it...
He saved it.
235
00:17:25,041 --> 00:17:26,567
Cheer up, guys.
236
00:17:27,365 --> 00:17:29,161

Look cheerful.
237
00:17:29,584 --> 00:17:32,145

"<i>Lift up your hearts!</i>"
It's all right.
238
00:17:44,962 --> 00:17:48,196
Come on, Coach,
don't be like this. It's all right.
239
00:17:52,801 --> 00:17:54,280
This is his room.
240
00:17:56,710 --> 00:17:58,832

Look who's come to visit you!
241
00:17:59,048 --> 00:18:01,031

- Hi. - Hi.
- Hi. Come in.
242
00:18:03,801 --> 00:18:07,294
Hey, Pietro Moretti,
what's happening to you this year?
243
00:18:07,465 --> 00:18:08,862
It's not bad here.
244
00:18:08,962 --> 00:18:10,975

It's better than going
to school!
245
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:15,285
- Is it true that Trillini almost
scored a goal against Virtus? - No.
246
00:18:15,927 --> 00:18:17,438
We lost 7-0.
247
00:18:18,076 --> 00:18:22,551

- This year the odds are stacked against us.
- There's still the second half of the season.
248
00:18:22,651 --> 00:18:25,719
I'll be out in two days and
I'll go back to training, won't I?
249
00:18:26,472 --> 00:18:27,327
Yeah...
250
00:18:27,995 --> 00:18:29,723

So you're returning
to school...
251
00:18:34,859 --> 00:18:37,259
I can't play anymore, can I?
252
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:39,740

Answer me:
I can't play anymore, can I?
253
00:18:40,146 --> 00:18:41,901
Now Pietro is tired.
254
00:18:42,268 --> 00:18:44,676

Now he's tired.
Thanks for visiting.
255
00:18:44,910 --> 00:18:46,682
- Thank you.
- Bye. - Bye.
256
00:18:46,782 --> 00:18:48,445
Thank you, everyone.
257
00:18:53,256 --> 00:18:55,477

Next year I'll put together
such a good team,
258
00:18:55,577 --> 00:18:59,453
that we'll finish among the first
three positions, I'm telling you.
259
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:15,572
Welcome back, Pietro.
260
00:19:18,476 --> 00:19:19,445

How are you?
261
00:19:19,545 --> 00:19:20,519

Fine.
262
00:19:35,921 --> 00:19:38,966

I'll come over at 4 p.m., then,
after swim practice.
263
00:19:39,066 --> 00:19:42,311
- Hey, has your career been cut short?
- What do you want?
264
00:19:42,411 --> 00:19:44,768
- "What do you want?"
- Leave him alone;
265
00:19:44,868 --> 00:19:50,508
- the teacher said he needs to relax.
- He needs to relax. Poor thing!
266
00:19:50,740 --> 00:19:53,298
Stay out of this;
I didn't ask for your help.
267
00:19:53,842 --> 00:19:56,381
What's happening?
What are you fighting about?
268
00:19:56,481 --> 00:19:59,341
Why are you treating her badly?
Apologize to her right now!
269
00:19:59,441 --> 00:20:01,959
No, I'm not apologizing
to anyone.
270
00:20:03,187 --> 00:20:06,064
Pietro, why are you treating
Simonetta badly?
271
00:20:14,620 --> 00:20:16,630
That's enough.
Thank you.
272
00:20:32,811 --> 00:20:35,619
I can confirm there's nothing
irregular. It's all right.
273
00:20:35,914 --> 00:20:39,341
- Why did he faint, then?
- He had a lipothymic attack.
274
00:20:39,995 --> 00:20:41,167
"Lipothymic"?
275
00:20:47,117 --> 00:20:50,736

Despite its difficult name,
it's a simple nervous reflex,
276
00:20:51,060 --> 00:20:54,620
that causes acceleration or
deceleration of cardiac activity,
277
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:57,683
<i>and fainting in more
susceptible individuals.</i>
278
00:20:58,149 --> 00:21:01,294
- <i>Could it happen again?</i>
- <i>It can't be ruled out.</i>
279
00:21:02,137 --> 00:21:04,068
Mom, what did he say?
280
00:21:04,256 --> 00:21:06,243

Can I get back to the pitch?
281
00:21:06,428 --> 00:21:07,413

Not yet.
282
00:21:10,810 --> 00:21:12,696

Mom, what's wrong with me?
283
00:21:13,341 --> 00:21:16,547

Nothing, darling.
You just need to calm down a bit.
284
00:21:16,697 --> 00:21:18,590
We both need to calm down.
285
00:21:20,405 --> 00:21:21,588

You're all right.
286
00:21:25,619 --> 00:21:29,280

<i>After what happened, Mom is getting
more and more worried.</i>
287
00:21:29,380 --> 00:21:32,951
<i>I think the doctors told her
there's something wrong with my heart,</i>
288
00:21:33,051 --> 00:21:34,805
<i>but she won't tell me.</i>
289
00:21:35,528 --> 00:21:39,012

<i>I'm really afraid I won't be able
to play football anymore.</i>
290
00:21:39,357 --> 00:21:43,844
<i>I'm sorry to disappoint you,
but I'll never get to "Serie A".</i>
291
00:21:45,996 --> 00:21:47,133
<i>That sucks!</i>
292
00:21:47,368 --> 00:21:51,147

<i>If life is like this, then you didn't
miss anything by dying.</i>
293
00:21:52,656 --> 00:21:57,065
<i>Sometimes I really want to see you,
to hear your voice, to talk with you.</i>
294
00:21:58,314 --> 00:21:59,431
<i>Bye, Dad.</i>
295
00:22:06,773 --> 00:22:08,670

Now you have to eat, huh?
296
00:22:10,153 --> 00:22:11,327

Eat, I said.
297
00:22:13,607 --> 00:22:16,162

Next week
I'll start training again.
298
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:19,415
Third Photographic Exhibition
"The World of Oases"
299
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:25,775
Good evening. I wanted to know
how your son's doing.
300
00:22:25,875 --> 00:22:27,356
He's better, thank you.
301
00:22:27,456 --> 00:22:29,648

- Where is he, now?
- At home.
302
00:22:30,009 --> 00:22:32,369
- Welcome, Mr. Mayor.
- Good morning. Thank you.
303
00:22:32,469 --> 00:22:35,269
- We are ready for the award ceremony.
- Excuse me.
304
00:22:35,369 --> 00:22:38,459
The Jury has awarded the prize
to the photos that,
305
00:22:38,559 --> 00:22:41,524
in addition to being of aesthetic
and artistic value,
306
00:22:41,624 --> 00:22:44,009
document the return
to the oasis...
307
00:22:44,802 --> 00:22:46,276
of the kingfisher.
308
00:22:46,442 --> 00:22:49,510

Before awarding the prize to
these photos that document...
309
00:22:49,610 --> 00:22:51,790
one of the most beautiful
corners of Italy,
310
00:22:51,890 --> 00:22:56,830
which we are fortunate enough
to protect in our municipal territory (...)
311
00:22:57,200 --> 00:23:00,936
- Where's the German?
- I don't know. He was here a minute ago.
312
00:23:01,118 --> 00:23:03,414
Go and get him,
or he'll get lost.
313
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:07,946
(the mayor continues
his speech)
314
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:14,351
What are you doing here?
Are you hiding?
315
00:23:15,870 --> 00:23:17,250
It's incredible!
316
00:23:23,961 --> 00:23:26,163

It's beautiful.
I'm astonished.
317
00:23:26,948 --> 00:23:29,446
Yes, it's beautiful,
but they're waiting for you.
318
00:23:29,546 --> 00:23:31,923
Just a moment.
It's so incredibly beautiful!
319
00:23:33,637 --> 00:23:35,709
We have to go.
The mayor is waiting for you.
320
00:23:36,430 --> 00:23:38,498
I've waited a long time, too.
321
00:23:38,691 --> 00:23:41,254

This is no time to start
a controversy. Let's go.
322
00:23:41,354 --> 00:23:43,931
Everything is a problem, here.
The oasis is a problem,
323
00:23:44,031 --> 00:23:47,895
bureaucracy is a problem,
building bird hides is a problem,
324
00:23:48,887 --> 00:23:51,778
and even receiving
a prize is a problem, for me.
325
00:23:51,878 --> 00:23:57,017
The prize goes to an extraordinary photo
of a kingfisher, taken by Mr. Hoffman,
326
00:23:57,226 --> 00:23:59,282
who is joining us, at last.
327
00:24:12,691 --> 00:24:13,588

Hello?
328
00:24:17,469 --> 00:24:19,605

Okay, I'll eat the food
in the fridge.
329
00:24:19,705 --> 00:24:21,101
Okay, don't worry.
330
00:24:21,291 --> 00:24:22,514

Okay.
Bye.
331
00:24:22,811 --> 00:24:23,590
Yes!
332
00:24:41,379 --> 00:24:41,991

Hey!
333
00:24:42,091 --> 00:24:43,323

Do you see us?
334
00:24:43,572 --> 00:24:44,475

We're here!
335
00:24:44,985 --> 00:24:48,018

- Come on!
- See? He even came to the party!
336
00:24:48,118 --> 00:24:50,991
- Ignore him.
- Come and sit down.
337
00:24:53,042 --> 00:24:55,522
Nice party, isn't it?
It's fun!
338
00:24:55,622 --> 00:24:57,836
Perfect organization!
339
00:24:58,175 --> 00:24:58,983

Huh?
340
00:24:59,573 --> 00:25:01,573

- So?
- "So"... what?
341
00:25:01,626 --> 00:25:03,817
- Shall we dance?
- Great idea, Missiroli!
342
00:25:03,846 --> 00:25:06,986
Look what partner you've got!
Come on, let's go!
343
00:25:12,485 --> 00:25:13,837
Aren't you dancing?
344
00:25:14,673 --> 00:25:16,532

No, I'd better not dance.
345
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:20,751

Have a seat, then.
346
00:25:28,363 --> 00:25:31,189

The music isn't great,
but I like dancing.
347
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:43,353
I installed my hides
in the agreed-upon locations.
348
00:25:43,453 --> 00:25:44,357
Uh-uh.
349
00:25:44,674 --> 00:25:49,750

- Now you have to "give" an inspection.
- We say "to <i>make</i> an inspection".
350
00:25:50,517 --> 00:25:51,432
Sorry.
351
00:25:53,968 --> 00:25:57,639

I thought maybe
you can come tomorrow,
352
00:25:58,222 --> 00:26:00,113
with your son... if he's fine.
353
00:26:01,841 --> 00:26:03,522

I don't think it's necessary.
354
00:26:05,954 --> 00:26:07,156

If you come...
355
00:26:09,185 --> 00:26:10,715

I can try to dance.
356
00:26:14,977 --> 00:26:16,451

The forecast is good.
357
00:26:17,146 --> 00:26:20,657

- What forecast?
- Weather forecast... Rain or shine.
358
00:26:26,068 --> 00:26:28,404
Isn't this German dancing?
359
00:26:28,940 --> 00:26:32,461

- No, I can't dance.
- Ah, you can't? I can.
360
00:26:33,001 --> 00:26:34,099
Moretti...
361
00:26:34,710 --> 00:26:35,893

Let's dance.
362
00:26:36,493 --> 00:26:38,597

Maestro,
"The Polka of Love".
363
00:26:48,780 --> 00:26:50,837
You know, Francesca...
364
00:26:51,091 --> 00:26:54,349

I was thinking... We've known
each other for many years,
365
00:26:54,653 --> 00:26:57,460
yet I don't remember
you ever telling me:
366
00:26:58,924 --> 00:26:59,936
"Aldo..."
367
00:27:00,829 --> 00:27:01,818

I mean...
368
00:27:02,036 --> 00:27:03,279

"Aldo, you..."
369
00:27:03,912 --> 00:27:06,695

In short, you've never told me
anything nice,
370
00:27:06,795 --> 00:27:08,577
as if I were a ghost to you.
371
00:27:08,677 --> 00:27:10,574

I'm thinking that...
372
00:27:10,781 --> 00:27:12,987

maybe this means something.
373
00:27:13,372 --> 00:27:14,029

Huh?
374
00:27:14,129 --> 00:27:15,318

Besides...
375
00:27:15,559 --> 00:27:18,662

Besides, you're a little drunk,
tonight, Mr. Missiroli.
376
00:27:18,762 --> 00:27:21,948
It's because of that German, right?
I've seen how he looks at you.
377
00:27:22,048 --> 00:27:26,275
- How does he look at me?
- He looks at you, but I saw you first.
378
00:27:30,039 --> 00:27:30,912
No...
379
00:27:31,536 --> 00:27:33,442

I was just kidding!
380
00:27:36,052 --> 00:27:39,667

I'm not kidding at all. Don't you
understand you must leave me alone?
381
00:27:41,039 --> 00:27:44,402
Roberto's been dead for a few months,
but it's as if he were still here.
382
00:27:44,502 --> 00:27:46,822
Did you see what happened
to Pietro on the pitch?
383
00:27:47,285 --> 00:27:48,590
Yes.
Exactly.
384
00:27:49,484 --> 00:27:50,747
He needs a mentor.
385
00:27:50,927 --> 00:27:52,455

No, he needs only me.
386
00:27:53,099 --> 00:27:57,421

And I don't need someone following me
around all day. Don't you understand?
387
00:28:17,284 --> 00:28:18,843
They arrived two days ago.
388
00:28:22,372 --> 00:28:23,349

Beautiful.
389
00:28:26,148 --> 00:28:31,632

- Is this where you took the photo of the
kingfisher? - No. You can't get there by boat.
390
00:29:07,235 --> 00:29:08,289
There it is.
391
00:29:08,483 --> 00:29:12,328

Do you see it? My hide is there,
among those reeds.
392
00:30:27,478 --> 00:30:28,736
Come and get it.
393
00:30:34,083 --> 00:30:35,625

- How old is he?
- 9 months old.
394
00:30:38,572 --> 00:30:40,914
Shit!
You're a professional player!
395
00:30:41,451 --> 00:30:44,174
- What team did you play for?
- For Bayern.
396
00:30:45,210 --> 00:30:46,506
Do you know Munich?
397
00:30:46,902 --> 00:30:49,905

Bayern Munich?
You played for Bayern Munich?!
398
00:30:59,112 --> 00:31:01,901
Pietro, what are you doing?
Have you both gone nuts?
399
00:31:02,211 --> 00:31:04,033
Mom, he used to play
for Bayern.
400
00:31:04,133 --> 00:31:06,402
"Bayern"!
Look how sweaty you are.
401
00:31:06,502 --> 00:31:08,832
Do you want to end up
in hospital again?
402
00:31:08,932 --> 00:31:12,747
I'm surprised at you! Didn't you see
what happened to him while he was playing?
403
00:31:12,847 --> 00:31:14,790
You don't have
any common sense!
404
00:31:37,990 --> 00:31:40,504
We could go out
for a pizza, tonight.
405
00:31:41,770 --> 00:31:43,933
We could invite
Simonetta, too.
406
00:31:45,745 --> 00:31:49,041
That's not fair.
I wanted to stay there. I wanted...
407
00:31:49,402 --> 00:31:53,653
- You don't know who Thomas is.
- And who's Thomas? A football player.
408
00:31:55,657 --> 00:31:58,687
He used to play for Bayern,
Beckenbauer's team,
409
00:31:58,787 --> 00:32:01,175
and you didn't even let me
play with him.
410
00:32:01,275 --> 00:32:03,658
He can teach me a lot of things
that the coach...
411
00:32:06,071 --> 00:32:07,696
I want to ask him to train me.
412
00:32:15,207 --> 00:32:16,275

Pietro...
413
00:32:19,441 --> 00:32:20,572

Pietro...
414
00:32:23,012 --> 00:32:25,840

Maybe I haven't been
clear enough with you.
415
00:32:26,328 --> 00:32:29,785
There's something I need
to tell you. Come on, sit down.
416
00:32:33,126 --> 00:32:35,389
You can't play football
for a while.
417
00:32:35,585 --> 00:32:38,297
You said I just couldn't play
in matches.
418
00:32:38,649 --> 00:32:42,726
Yes, but you mustn't strain yourself.
You need to take care of yourself for a while.
419
00:32:42,826 --> 00:32:48,068
- Do you think I'm happy? - The doctors
said there's nothing wrong with me.
420
00:32:48,313 --> 00:32:50,321
Yes, you're healthy,
thankfully.
421
00:32:50,442 --> 00:32:55,446
You just need to take care of yourself.
Next year everything will change, you'll see.
422
00:33:06,509 --> 00:33:08,706
- What is it?
- Are you already in bed?
423
00:33:09,199 --> 00:33:11,663
I didn't say "Come in".
You can't come in.
424
00:33:11,763 --> 00:33:12,665
Sorry.
425
00:33:13,152 --> 00:33:15,213

- Do you need anything?
- No.
426
00:33:16,025 --> 00:33:17,509
Good night, then.
427
00:34:02,562 --> 00:34:06,378

Can you make me become a champ?
I've brought everything with me.
428
00:34:07,056 --> 00:34:09,528
I'm sure you can teach me
a lot of things.
429
00:34:12,973 --> 00:34:17,078
If you want, you can give me some exercises
to do, and I can do them by myself.
430
00:34:18,739 --> 00:34:21,718
- Did your mother give you
permission? - Yes.
431
00:34:29,833 --> 00:34:30,842
Come.
432
00:34:33,420 --> 00:34:34,379

My ball!
433
00:34:34,822 --> 00:34:35,693

My ball!
434
00:34:39,175 --> 00:34:40,433

Why?
That's my ball!
435
00:34:45,215 --> 00:34:46,990
We don't need the ball.
436
00:34:47,506 --> 00:34:49,384

You said you'd train me...
437
00:34:50,008 --> 00:34:51,608

Listen carefully...
438
00:34:56,361 --> 00:34:59,002

The ball follows the foot.
439
00:35:00,113 --> 00:35:02,160

The foot follows the head.
440
00:35:03,284 --> 00:35:05,388

But what does the head follow?
441
00:35:06,177 --> 00:35:07,848

It follows the game plans.
442
00:35:07,987 --> 00:35:10,872

No, the game plans are already
in your head.
443
00:35:11,252 --> 00:35:12,270
Then...
444
00:35:12,617 --> 00:35:14,303

it follows the ball.
445
00:35:15,201 --> 00:35:16,013

No...
446
00:35:16,113 --> 00:35:20,263

The head never follows the ball.
Otherwise, do you know what happens?
447
00:35:20,648 --> 00:35:21,960
What happens?
448
00:35:22,778 --> 00:35:25,309

You lose it.
It rolls away from you.
449
00:35:46,831 --> 00:35:48,996
Try to stay still.
Look outside.
450
00:35:49,763 --> 00:35:52,294
You have to be the first
to see it.
451
00:36:01,312 --> 00:36:03,087
So? Haven't you seen anything?
452
00:36:03,632 --> 00:36:04,955

- No.
- Shh.
453
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:08,405
Look more carefully.
454
00:36:10,490 --> 00:36:12,471

Down there, on that branch.
455
00:36:16,620 --> 00:36:17,371

There.
456
00:36:21,759 --> 00:36:23,919

It has seen something
moving under the water.
457
00:36:45,841 --> 00:36:49,734
It saw the fish passing by,
and determined its position and speed...
458
00:36:50,149 --> 00:36:52,452
in less than one tenth
of a second.
459
00:36:53,693 --> 00:36:55,928
How do you know
there's a fish under there?
460
00:36:56,109 --> 00:36:57,867
By looking at the kingfisher.
461
00:36:58,321 --> 00:36:59,832

"King"... what?
462
00:37:00,208 --> 00:37:02,659

And I can also tell you
it's not a small fish.
463
00:37:02,759 --> 00:37:07,033
If it had been small, the bird would
have attempted to catch it immediately.
464
00:37:07,272 --> 00:37:10,285
But it needs to be cautious
with a bigger one.
465
00:37:13,832 --> 00:37:19,035
- How did you know that?
- I've learned to watch, to see more.
466
00:37:37,198 --> 00:37:39,121
Pietro!
Pietro!
467
00:37:40,967 --> 00:37:42,094
What happened?
468
00:37:42,524 --> 00:37:44,822

Good morning, madam.
Isn't Pietro here?
469
00:37:45,093 --> 00:37:47,616
Weren't you supposed to do
your homework together?
470
00:37:47,716 --> 00:37:50,790
I wanted to ask him if he wanted
to do a class project with me.
471
00:37:53,159 --> 00:37:54,931
Oh well, I'm off, then.
472
00:38:02,305 --> 00:38:03,788

What's the matter?
473
00:38:04,234 --> 00:38:06,694

I get it; you agree
with my mother.
474
00:38:08,466 --> 00:38:12,238
You're telling me all these things
because you don't want to train me.
475
00:38:12,338 --> 00:38:16,981
Do you think I don't know that one can't
play, if one isn't in shape physically?
476
00:38:17,081 --> 00:38:19,895
Okay, do you want to do
an exercise?
477
00:38:20,563 --> 00:38:22,291
Take off your shoes.
478
00:38:30,310 --> 00:38:32,173

It's quite straight, huh?
479
00:38:40,107 --> 00:38:42,473

Now come here.
Walk on the line.
480
00:38:42,924 --> 00:38:44,618
- How?
- Just walk on it.
481
00:38:45,295 --> 00:38:46,679
Well, it's easy.
482
00:38:54,370 --> 00:38:57,840

Now do it again,
but... "without eyes".
483
00:38:58,531 --> 00:39:00,249
- With my eyes closed?
- Yes.
484
00:39:00,349 --> 00:39:01,784
Piece of cake!
485
00:39:09,287 --> 00:39:10,062

Stop!
486
00:39:13,650 --> 00:39:16,434

- Shoot!
- Do you still think it's easy?
487
00:39:16,973 --> 00:39:21,173
- I thought I was going very straight.
- You have to try again until you get it right.
488
00:39:22,785 --> 00:39:23,586
Come on.
489
00:39:37,175 --> 00:39:38,794

The line is here!
490
00:39:58,612 --> 00:40:01,206

- What is that exercise for?
- Quiet!
491
00:40:01,816 --> 00:40:04,211
First do it,
and then ask questions.
492
00:40:07,678 --> 00:40:08,769
It's cold!
493
00:40:12,003 --> 00:40:14,642

You'll get used to it
in a minute. Come on!
494
00:40:31,699 --> 00:40:33,718
Faster!
Come on! Come on!
495
00:40:34,255 --> 00:40:35,731
Come on, go!
Go!
496
00:40:37,671 --> 00:40:38,570
Good.
497
00:41:10,101 --> 00:41:13,284

Do you want to keep exercising
or is that enough?
498
00:41:18,802 --> 00:41:22,528
I've called all his friends.
I don't know whom else to call.
499
00:41:23,130 --> 00:41:24,410
Let's hope so.
500
00:41:25,952 --> 00:41:29,858

Someone rang the doorbell. Maybe it's him.
I'll call you back, Mirella. Bye.
501
00:41:32,350 --> 00:41:33,589
Am I disturbing you?
502
00:41:35,141 --> 00:41:38,265

I wanted to apologize
about the other night.
503
00:41:38,844 --> 00:41:40,068
- May I...?
- No!
504
00:42:41,008 --> 00:42:42,069
At last!
505
00:42:42,169 --> 00:42:44,375

Where have you been?
What happened?
506
00:42:44,475 --> 00:42:46,009
- Good evening.
- Good evening!
507
00:42:46,109 --> 00:42:49,571
Nothing happened. I was doing
an exercise and I slipped into the water.
508
00:42:49,671 --> 00:42:53,344
One lie after another, huh?
Why didn't you go to Simonetta's?
509
00:42:53,444 --> 00:42:55,938
- She's really stupid.
- Shut up! Don't talk back!
510
00:42:56,296 --> 00:42:59,413
Don't you know
Pietro mustn't strain himself?
511
00:42:59,807 --> 00:43:02,840
It's true: we went to take
some photos and then...
512
00:43:02,940 --> 00:43:06,027
- It was a concentration exercise.
- An "exercise"...
513
00:43:06,127 --> 00:43:08,288
Look at you:
you're all wet!
514
00:43:14,186 --> 00:43:16,256
Come here.
Let me dry you off.
515
00:43:16,641 --> 00:43:20,599
Go and get changed, now.
And give me this sweater; it's not ours.
516
00:43:22,270 --> 00:43:25,246
Please, don't complicate
the situation.
517
00:43:27,190 --> 00:43:30,363
Take your sweater
and leave us alone, now.
518
00:43:31,433 --> 00:43:34,412
You're right,
but he looked very sad.
519
00:43:34,969 --> 00:43:38,780
- I think... - Thank you for your
good will. Now, if you'll excuse me...
520
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:40,909
These are Pietro's clothes.
521
00:44:07,639 --> 00:44:08,743

<i>Mom!</i>
522
00:44:14,023 --> 00:44:14,883

Mom!
523
00:44:16,355 --> 00:44:17,024

Mom!
524
00:44:19,841 --> 00:44:20,802

<i>Mom!</i>
525
00:44:23,391 --> 00:44:24,572

What is it?
526
00:44:24,850 --> 00:44:25,932

I'm cold.
527
00:44:26,528 --> 00:44:28,087

What's the matter, my love?
528
00:44:28,187 --> 00:44:29,382

You're hot!
529
00:44:30,439 --> 00:44:31,503

I'm cold.
530
00:44:33,096 --> 00:44:34,767

Come on, put this on.
531
00:44:35,957 --> 00:44:38,891

- I'm cold.
- You're hot, my love.
532
00:44:39,667 --> 00:44:41,577
That irresponsible idiot...
533
00:44:41,880 --> 00:44:42,950

You know, Mom?
534
00:44:43,050 --> 00:44:44,756

Thomas has X-ray vision.
535
00:44:44,856 --> 00:44:48,637

- He can see fish through water.
- No! What are you talking about?
536
00:44:50,270 --> 00:44:52,120
Now try to sleep.
Come on.
537
00:44:53,007 --> 00:44:55,120
I'll stay right here with you.
538
00:44:55,292 --> 00:44:57,309

- Are you still cold?
- Yes.
539
00:44:57,819 --> 00:44:59,842
- Now I'm here with you.
- I'm cold.
540
00:44:59,942 --> 00:45:01,915
Now I'll warm you up,
my love.
541
00:45:02,015 --> 00:45:02,768
Huh?
542
00:45:33,778 --> 00:45:35,045

I didn't score.
543
00:45:35,759 --> 00:45:37,158

I didn't score.
544
00:45:37,853 --> 00:45:39,398

It's not my fault!
545
00:45:39,754 --> 00:45:41,238

It's not my fault!
546
00:45:41,411 --> 00:45:42,274

Dad...
547
00:45:42,612 --> 00:45:44,279

Dad, please, help me!
548
00:45:45,350 --> 00:45:46,918

Calm down!
Calm down!
549
00:45:47,018 --> 00:45:49,547
Calm down, my love.
It's a bad dream.
550
00:45:50,316 --> 00:45:51,789
It's a bad dream.
551
00:46:01,775 --> 00:46:02,601

Francesca!
552
00:46:03,508 --> 00:46:04,494

Francesca!
553
00:46:06,273 --> 00:46:09,503

- Come down. It's late.
- Go alone. Pietro is sick.
554
00:46:09,934 --> 00:46:12,358
Come on!
What should I say, this time?
555
00:46:12,652 --> 00:46:14,718
It's the truth.
He has a very high fever.
556
00:46:14,942 --> 00:46:18,315
- Do you need anything?
- No, I'm waiting for the doctor.
557
00:46:18,415 --> 00:46:21,801
- We'll talk later.
- I'll call you. Kiss Pietrino for me.
558
00:46:22,835 --> 00:46:23,556
Bye.
559
00:46:26,108 --> 00:46:27,770

Don't worry, it's nothing.
560
00:46:27,962 --> 00:46:29,792

It's just influenza.
561
00:46:30,178 --> 00:46:32,267

Are you sure?
He looks so strange.
562
00:46:32,367 --> 00:46:36,013
Listen, I've heard you're not
letting Pietro play anymore.
563
00:46:36,292 --> 00:46:39,107
You know there's nothing
wrong with him, don't you?
564
00:46:39,207 --> 00:46:41,642
What does football have
to do with this?
565
00:46:41,742 --> 00:46:43,905
I'm not a psychologist, but...
566
00:46:44,339 --> 00:46:46,961

his father was even keener
on football than he is.
567
00:46:47,061 --> 00:46:50,556
In short, I don't think it's a good idea
not to let him play.
568
00:46:50,656 --> 00:46:55,225
- He's not the same anymore. I don't know
what to do for him. - Francesca...
569
00:46:55,601 --> 00:46:57,609
I think <i>you</i> are the problem,
570
00:46:57,902 --> 00:46:58,852

not him.
571
00:46:59,201 --> 00:47:00,377

I have to go now.
572
00:47:00,477 --> 00:47:03,831

Don't worry; tonight the boy
will be better, you'll see. Bye.
573
00:47:03,931 --> 00:47:04,729
Bye.
574
00:47:14,101 --> 00:47:17,471

He's better. It is you who look
like death warmed up!
575
00:47:17,673 --> 00:47:18,621
Hey...
576
00:47:18,963 --> 00:47:22,296

Today Missiroli was
pissed off as hell!
577
00:47:22,695 --> 00:47:25,812
He said he'll have to send
a doctor to verify your illness.
578
00:47:25,912 --> 00:47:29,618
Yes, I know. He called me.
But I don't give a damn.
579
00:47:29,718 --> 00:47:33,459
Francesca, if you want me to buy
groceries, I'm at your disposal.
580
00:47:37,937 --> 00:47:39,646
- Hello?
- <i>Good evening.</i>
581
00:47:39,746 --> 00:47:41,767
<i>I wanted to know
how Pietro's doing.</i>
582
00:47:41,867 --> 00:47:45,756
You should have seen this coming.
Did you think my son was an aquatic bird?
583
00:47:45,856 --> 00:47:47,708
<i>Can I speak to him?</i>
584
00:47:47,808 --> 00:47:51,111

No, I can't put him on the phone.
He's in bed with a high fever.
585
00:47:51,314 --> 00:47:54,410
Now, excuse me, I'm waiting for
the doctor's call. Goodbye.
586
00:47:56,098 --> 00:47:59,140
(imitating a German accent)
Was it that German, wasn't it?
587
00:47:59,240 --> 00:48:01,024
You're always
in a mood to joke.
588
00:48:01,419 --> 00:48:03,442
Obviously.
You have no children.
589
00:48:03,542 --> 00:48:06,849
(imitating a German accent)
I don't have a boyfriend, either!
590
00:48:07,526 --> 00:48:10,346
Mom, why did you hang up
on Thomas?
591
00:48:10,446 --> 00:48:13,587
You can't do that. He wanted
to speak with me. That's not fair.
592
00:48:19,287 --> 00:48:21,144
I never do anything right.
593
00:48:22,039 --> 00:48:24,281

But I'm doing my best,
Roberto.
594
00:48:26,168 --> 00:48:28,609
You shouldn't have
done that to me.
595
00:48:29,904 --> 00:48:31,735
Leaving me like that...
596
00:48:33,946 --> 00:48:36,087

What should I do about Pietro?
597
00:48:38,542 --> 00:48:40,713

You left me in such a lurch...
598
00:48:45,967 --> 00:48:48,055

- Good morning.
- Good morning.
599
00:48:48,155 --> 00:48:50,361
I'm Francesca, Pietro's mom.
Do you remember?
600
00:48:50,726 --> 00:48:52,656
- The football player?
- Yes.
601
00:48:52,927 --> 00:48:55,571
- How is he?
- Much better. Thank you.
602
00:48:56,029 --> 00:49:00,461
- I'm looking for Thomas. - Who can
find him? I haven't seen him for two days!
603
00:49:00,561 --> 00:49:03,484
- He's running after a barn owl.
- Would you do me a favour?
604
00:49:03,838 --> 00:49:08,068
- When you see him, tell him I need
to talk to him urgently. - I will.
605
00:49:08,321 --> 00:49:11,166
- Thank you. Have a nice day.
- Thank <i>you</i>.
606
00:49:15,519 --> 00:49:16,364
Mom!
607
00:49:16,702 --> 00:49:18,270

Mom, aren't you ready yet?
608
00:49:18,370 --> 00:49:22,169

It's not 8:00 yet. It's Sunday morning.
People sleep at this hour.
609
00:49:23,207 --> 00:49:24,184
I'll get it.
610
00:49:26,889 --> 00:49:27,971

May I come in?
611
00:49:28,071 --> 00:49:30,341

It's beautiful!
Is it Beckenbauer's?
612
00:49:30,441 --> 00:49:31,763
No, it's mine.
613
00:49:32,460 --> 00:49:34,057

Thank you.
Come in.
614
00:49:36,385 --> 00:49:37,990
And this is for you.
615
00:49:42,934 --> 00:49:46,498

Often, we have something on our minds
that doesn't allow us to see well.
616
00:49:46,598 --> 00:49:48,672
It is not only
the eyes that see.
617
00:49:48,772 --> 00:49:51,667
That's why you fell
into the water last time.
618
00:49:52,064 --> 00:49:54,166
- Good morning.
- Good morning!
619
00:49:54,852 --> 00:49:57,449
I'm very happy you've come
to visit Pietro.
620
00:49:59,885 --> 00:50:03,086
To give you an example,
your mother thought I was crazy...
621
00:50:03,186 --> 00:50:06,281
because I made you take a "bath"
in that ice-cold water.
622
00:50:07,230 --> 00:50:09,690
Whose brilliant idea was that,
then?
623
00:50:11,266 --> 00:50:15,440
Sometimes too much enthusiasm
to learn leads to some mistake.
624
00:50:16,854 --> 00:50:19,748
But we still have to do
many exercises together,
625
00:50:20,307 --> 00:50:21,744
and take some photos.
626
00:50:22,602 --> 00:50:24,451

This one, for example...
627
00:50:25,854 --> 00:50:27,357

We took it together.
628
00:50:27,573 --> 00:50:28,934

It's beautiful!
629
00:50:29,131 --> 00:50:29,920

But...
630
00:50:30,215 --> 00:50:32,375

Is this a kingfisher
landing on the water?
631
00:50:32,475 --> 00:50:34,467
- No.
- No. Just the opposite.
632
00:50:35,058 --> 00:50:38,775
It's taking flight. See?
It has just grabbed the fish.
633
00:50:39,602 --> 00:50:41,067
Um-hum.
Nice photo.
634
00:50:41,601 --> 00:50:44,054
Even grown-ups don't look
carefully sometimes.
635
00:50:44,658 --> 00:50:48,066
Looking carefully is even harder
than scoring a penalty.
636
00:50:48,473 --> 00:50:50,643
So I can go back
to the oasis with Thomas.
637
00:50:50,743 --> 00:50:54,888
- That's OK with me. But you should ask him.
- That's OK with me, too. But not today.
638
00:50:55,933 --> 00:50:59,113
- Today is "city day".
- What do you mean by "city day"?
639
00:50:59,283 --> 00:51:02,370
Today everyone's going for a walk
in the oasis. It's terrible!
640
00:51:03,465 --> 00:51:05,998
So I'm going to the city,
because it's less crowded.
641
00:51:07,062 --> 00:51:10,081
(in imperfect Italian)
There, I can meet some humans.
642
00:51:11,362 --> 00:51:15,907
(in imperfect Italian) If I spent all my time
with animals, I'd become too "savage".
643
00:51:17,718 --> 00:51:19,004
We say "wild".
644
00:51:20,018 --> 00:51:20,900

"Wild".
645
00:51:35,238 --> 00:51:37,437

So I'm not going
to find you at home.
646
00:51:37,537 --> 00:51:41,534
Now my mother is okay with me going to
the oasis, but I don't know when I'm going.
647
00:51:41,634 --> 00:51:45,073
- I told her I wanted to go when school ends.
- Will she let you?
648
00:51:45,173 --> 00:51:47,202
Sure.
Now she'll let me go.
649
00:51:47,726 --> 00:51:50,139
I might come and see you,
sometime.
650
00:52:03,012 --> 00:52:05,540
- Be good.
- Don't worry.
651
00:52:16,078 --> 00:52:17,070
Don't worry.
652
00:52:18,876 --> 00:52:20,330

Try to understand:
653
00:52:20,523 --> 00:52:24,470

it's the first time we've been apart
since... his father's death.
654
00:52:26,946 --> 00:52:29,312
I know I may sound
a bit stupid...
655
00:52:30,552 --> 00:52:32,946
but, please, you be good, too.
656
00:53:22,009 --> 00:53:23,814

Look!
They're taking off.
657
00:53:25,388 --> 00:53:28,496
How did you know
they were about to take flight?
658
00:53:30,630 --> 00:53:33,116
Look up there.
There's a young hawk.
659
00:53:35,371 --> 00:53:36,794
It had no luck.
660
00:53:38,685 --> 00:53:42,131

- Look carefully: it keeps gliding.
- To make less effort?
661
00:53:43,173 --> 00:53:46,112
No. If it flaps its wings,
it'll become more conspicuous.
662
00:53:46,212 --> 00:53:48,554
That way, it can observe
without being seen.
663
00:53:49,506 --> 00:53:53,609
All animals and humans react
to fast movements,
664
00:53:55,003 --> 00:53:56,590
and become less careful if...
665
00:53:57,389 --> 00:53:58,102

Look!
666
00:54:03,378 --> 00:54:06,781

It chose the wrong time to attack.
There's nothing more it can do.
667
00:54:08,281 --> 00:54:12,281
I wish I could stop this moment
and make it last as long as I like.
668
00:54:13,342 --> 00:54:15,602
What do you mean?
Elaborate.
669
00:54:16,806 --> 00:54:19,080
I don't know...
Like in a photograph,
670
00:54:19,180 --> 00:54:23,898
but better, because when you freeze
an image in a photograph, you're not in it.
671
00:54:24,251 --> 00:54:26,082
You can only look at it.
672
00:54:26,786 --> 00:54:28,112

Stopping time.
673
00:54:28,801 --> 00:54:30,927

Yes, exactly.
Stopping time.
674
00:54:31,604 --> 00:54:33,572
It can't be stopped, though.
675
00:54:34,489 --> 00:54:36,719

Children know
how to stop time.
676
00:54:38,747 --> 00:54:41,118
You're different
from other adults.
677
00:54:42,104 --> 00:54:45,625
Someone once told me
I had remained a child.
678
00:54:47,695 --> 00:54:50,403
And that person refused
to see me again.
679
00:54:51,164 --> 00:54:52,421
Who was that person?
680
00:55:52,961 --> 00:55:54,267

Hey, Pietro!
681
00:55:54,673 --> 00:55:56,070

No more "baths"!
682
00:55:56,649 --> 00:55:57,691

Don't rush.
683
00:55:57,791 --> 00:56:01,406

"Rush"? We haven't touched
the ball yet since I came here.
684
00:56:01,584 --> 00:56:04,213
We're not even talking
about football.
685
00:56:05,729 --> 00:56:08,358
I've already told you
that you're good.
686
00:56:10,450 --> 00:56:12,651
The problem is not the foot.
687
00:56:14,425 --> 00:56:18,030

The ball follows the foot.
688
00:56:18,380 --> 00:56:22,327

The foot follows the head.
But what is it that the head follows?
689
00:56:23,828 --> 00:56:27,112
If you don't find this out,
there's no point in training.
690
00:56:27,404 --> 00:56:30,850
If it's so important,
why don't you tell me what it is?
691
00:56:31,061 --> 00:56:33,559
It's not something
you need to know.
692
00:56:33,850 --> 00:56:36,836
It's something
you need to... see.
693
00:56:38,883 --> 00:56:41,150
No one other than
you can see it.
694
00:56:45,305 --> 00:56:46,550
Come on!
695
00:56:46,814 --> 00:56:47,915

Come on.
696
00:56:48,181 --> 00:56:50,740

A new exercise:
hit it with your head.
697
00:56:50,965 --> 00:56:52,007
Come on, go.
698
00:56:55,072 --> 00:56:56,132

It's too high.
699
00:56:56,232 --> 00:56:59,819

You have to do this exercise
until you're able to hit it,
700
00:56:59,919 --> 00:57:02,483
- every time you pass
through here. - Okay.
701
00:57:09,363 --> 00:57:11,062
Come on!
Come on!
702
00:59:21,427 --> 00:59:23,296
Where are you going, Pietro?
Stop.
703
00:59:23,396 --> 00:59:25,957
- What happened?
- Why did it come at me?
704
00:59:26,057 --> 00:59:30,445
Because you were afraid, and it sensed it.
Animals can sense when you're afraid of them.
705
00:59:30,545 --> 00:59:32,829
And you, why didn't you tell me
it was there?
706
00:59:36,590 --> 00:59:40,731
When I took these photos, I knew
you were going to miss the penalty.
707
00:59:41,181 --> 00:59:43,291
And not because I'm a wizard.
708
00:59:43,999 --> 00:59:45,422

See why you missed it.
709
00:59:46,447 --> 00:59:48,568

My position...
I was unbalanced.
710
00:59:49,445 --> 00:59:52,221
No, Pietro, it wasn't because
of your foot position.
711
00:59:53,655 --> 00:59:54,927
The goalie...
712
00:59:55,119 --> 00:59:57,656

Maybe I didn't see
where the goalie was moving.
713
00:59:58,144 --> 00:59:59,232
Look here:
714
00:59:59,875 --> 01:00:02,027

these eyes don't see anything,
715
01:00:02,629 --> 01:00:04,801

but they know
they're making a mistake.
716
01:00:04,901 --> 01:00:05,752
See?
717
01:00:06,307 --> 01:00:08,166

Your eyes were the cause.
718
01:00:10,725 --> 01:00:14,190

- What are you doing?
- You have to dribble through the poles.
719
01:00:15,086 --> 01:00:18,155
- Our coach, too, makes us do this.
- Yes, but not in the water.
720
01:00:18,299 --> 01:00:19,616
What's the difference?
721
01:00:19,942 --> 01:00:24,712

The mud in the water sticks
to your feet. Your feet get heavier,
722
01:00:24,812 --> 01:00:27,736
and, as a result,
your muscles get stronger.
723
01:00:27,836 --> 01:00:29,163
Are you sure?
724
01:00:29,616 --> 01:00:34,499

Even black-winged stilts make
their chicks do this.
725
01:00:35,137 --> 01:00:36,320
So do it!
726
01:00:38,402 --> 01:00:40,634

Come on!
Come on! Faster!
727
01:00:42,304 --> 01:00:42,947
Go!
728
01:00:43,548 --> 01:00:44,515

Go! Go!
729
01:00:46,530 --> 01:00:47,445

Yes!
730
01:00:47,545 --> 01:00:48,421

Come on!
731
01:00:48,703 --> 01:00:49,445

Yes!
732
01:00:50,674 --> 01:00:51,632

Faster!
733
01:00:52,936 --> 01:00:54,941

What are you doing?
Faster!
734
01:00:55,420 --> 01:00:56,152
Yes!
735
01:00:56,739 --> 01:00:58,049

Now come back.
736
01:01:03,984 --> 01:01:06,273

You can walk straight
on the sand,
737
01:01:06,642 --> 01:01:08,580
but now you have
to do it there.
738
01:01:08,680 --> 01:01:09,559
What?!
739
01:01:12,772 --> 01:01:17,165

For the first time, I'll allow you
to do it with your eyes open.
740
01:01:17,891 --> 01:01:20,379
So, are you going
to start or not?
741
01:01:22,581 --> 01:01:24,877
Don't worry.
It's the same exercise.
742
01:01:35,193 --> 01:01:36,648
Open your arms.
743
01:01:37,563 --> 01:01:39,192

Like a flying bird.
744
01:01:39,985 --> 01:01:40,619

Yes.
745
01:01:47,799 --> 01:01:48,512

Hey!
746
01:01:49,724 --> 01:01:50,465

No!
747
01:01:53,677 --> 01:01:55,907

You could do it on the sand.
And now?
748
01:01:56,144 --> 01:01:57,500
Now it's different.
749
01:02:01,087 --> 01:02:04,312

- It's like when you shoot a penalty.
- What do you mean?
750
01:02:05,477 --> 01:02:08,578
You said you never miss one
in training.
751
01:02:08,759 --> 01:02:10,895
Why can't you score
in matches?
752
01:02:11,102 --> 01:02:14,019
In a match it's different.
The spectators look at you.
753
01:02:14,879 --> 01:02:17,274
You think about
the points in the table.
754
01:02:17,605 --> 01:02:19,210
It's more important.
755
01:02:20,174 --> 01:02:23,827

That's exactly the purpose
of the exercise.
756
01:02:24,071 --> 01:02:27,189
Don't think about
the spectators... or the water.
757
01:02:28,970 --> 01:02:31,280
You need to... feel yourself.
758
01:02:31,855 --> 01:02:35,725

Work on your concentration.
Don't think about anything else.
759
01:02:37,020 --> 01:02:38,518
Find your balance.
760
01:02:41,691 --> 01:02:42,508

Huh?
761
01:02:44,855 --> 01:02:45,822

Come on.
762
01:02:59,087 --> 01:03:02,256

Thank you for insisting.
It was a lovely day.
763
01:03:02,861 --> 01:03:05,594
Thank the German,
who's keeping your son!
764
01:03:06,589 --> 01:03:08,683
See? It's not so bad.
765
01:03:09,735 --> 01:03:11,870

I'm doing it for Pietro.
766
01:03:12,111 --> 01:03:15,472

- Yeah, you're doing it for Pietro...
- Yes, I'm doing it for Pietro!
767
01:03:15,572 --> 01:03:17,398
Yeah, sure...
768
01:03:18,258 --> 01:03:20,896

If you tell lies, your nose will grow,
like Pinocchio's.
769
01:03:20,996 --> 01:03:23,255
- I'm not lying!
- Go, go!
770
01:03:24,128 --> 01:03:26,833
Don't say
there's no girl you like.
771
01:03:27,522 --> 01:03:28,602
Come on!
772
01:03:29,823 --> 01:03:32,907

Actually,
a girl in my class likes me.
773
01:03:35,507 --> 01:03:38,672
What about you?
Don't you like her back?
774
01:03:41,693 --> 01:03:43,270
Why did you quit football?
775
01:03:44,752 --> 01:03:46,157

I had an accident.
776
01:03:46,367 --> 01:03:50,546

A teammate broke my knee during
practice. And do you know why?
777
01:03:52,929 --> 01:03:55,558
He wanted to take my place
in the team.
778
01:03:56,086 --> 01:03:57,558
Do you understand?
779
01:03:59,477 --> 01:04:02,495

So I said "No more football",
780
01:04:03,514 --> 01:04:06,626

and I looked for a job
that would take me far away,
781
01:04:06,907 --> 01:04:09,700
where I could live
without people around me,
782
01:04:10,866 --> 01:04:13,847
even though that caused
my wife to leave me.
783
01:04:14,998 --> 01:04:19,331
So it was she who told you
that you had remained a child.
784
01:04:22,532 --> 01:04:23,630
Do you miss her?
785
01:04:28,370 --> 01:04:32,648

And you? Do you think
about your father often?
786
01:04:36,611 --> 01:04:38,975
I no longer think
about him enough.
787
01:04:39,925 --> 01:04:43,741
There are entire days
where I don't think about him,
788
01:04:45,023 --> 01:04:47,276
and there are days
I spend thinking:
789
01:04:47,376 --> 01:04:50,448
"He's not coming back.
He's never coming back."
790
01:04:52,718 --> 01:04:54,629
I don't feel bad, though,
791
01:04:55,019 --> 01:04:58,653

because I know he would be
disappointed if he saw me now.
792
01:05:00,216 --> 01:05:03,191
We often believe
some things belong to the past,
793
01:05:04,112 --> 01:05:06,816
but these things are still
in our hearts.
794
01:05:08,084 --> 01:05:10,525
Like a hawk,
watching from above.
795
01:05:11,249 --> 01:05:13,878
We think it's not there,
796
01:05:14,517 --> 01:05:17,465

but it <i>is</i> there,
ready to come down.
797
01:05:18,524 --> 01:05:22,035
It glides silently,
without flapping its wings.
798
01:05:30,542 --> 01:05:31,842
Maybe I've got it.
799
01:05:31,942 --> 01:05:35,229

You said the head follows something,
but it's not the ball.
800
01:05:38,130 --> 01:05:40,411
It's something
that never stops.
801
01:05:44,158 --> 01:05:47,820
And sometimes it goes slowly,
sometimes it goes very fast.
802
01:05:50,246 --> 01:05:51,443
I've got it!
803
01:05:51,981 --> 01:05:55,779

When I'm afraid, it beats very fast
and I can't think clearly.
804
01:05:57,515 --> 01:06:01,872
Fear and courage
both come from there.
805
01:06:34,242 --> 01:06:35,246
Wake up.
806
01:06:36,674 --> 01:06:37,913

Wake up!
807
01:06:40,181 --> 01:06:41,642

Wake up!
808
01:06:41,974 --> 01:06:43,721

The sun is already up!
809
01:06:48,299 --> 01:06:50,871

- What time is it?
- 5:30.
810
01:06:51,769 --> 01:06:52,946
5:30...
811
01:06:54,575 --> 01:06:56,332

Do you want to stay
in bed all day?
812
01:07:00,778 --> 01:07:03,132
You've finally decided
to come!
813
01:07:04,108 --> 01:07:06,770
Come on,
take your mind off things a bit!
814
01:07:08,968 --> 01:07:10,525
Where are you going?
815
01:07:11,252 --> 01:07:13,891

- I have to make a call.
- To whom?
816
01:07:16,353 --> 01:07:19,149
Hello, this is Francesca.
Do you remember me?
817
01:07:20,738 --> 01:07:21,555
Yes.
818
01:07:21,883 --> 01:07:23,550

They aren't there?
819
01:07:23,909 --> 01:07:25,167

Are they okay?
820
01:07:27,394 --> 01:07:29,156

Listen, do me a favour, then.
821
01:07:29,256 --> 01:07:32,874

When they're back,
please tell Pietro to call me, okay?
822
01:07:33,540 --> 01:07:34,267
Thanks.
823
01:07:46,632 --> 01:07:48,660

Isn't that your mother's car?
824
01:07:52,111 --> 01:07:54,240

She said she'd come tomorrow!
825
01:08:27,148 --> 01:08:29,350

<i>Et voilà</i>,
a surprise for you!
826
01:08:39,915 --> 01:08:41,154
Thanks, Mom!
827
01:08:42,488 --> 01:08:46,235

- It's really cool! Look.
- He must have been driving you crazy, huh?
828
01:08:46,335 --> 01:08:50,281
Do you know, Mom, that at 9 p.m. I'm already
in bed? And I'm eating like a horse.
829
01:08:50,381 --> 01:08:52,019
That's a true miracle!
830
01:08:52,119 --> 01:08:54,507

That's our observatory.
I'm going to climb up.
831
01:08:54,607 --> 01:08:58,228
You'll hurt yourself!
Be careful. It could be dangerous!
832
01:08:58,328 --> 01:09:02,002
- Are you letting him go up there alone?
- There's no problem.
833
01:09:35,496 --> 01:09:37,196
Pietro's much better.
834
01:09:37,444 --> 01:09:40,373

- Thank you for your patience, Sir.
- "Sir"?
835
01:09:40,880 --> 01:09:42,711
Well, "Sir" or "Thomas".
836
01:09:42,811 --> 01:09:48,275

I never know when I can drop
the formalities, here in Italy.
837
01:09:49,101 --> 01:09:53,089
Some people call me
Thomas right away.
838
01:09:54,159 --> 01:09:58,713
- But when is it the right moment to drop them?
- Well, this could be a good moment.
839
01:09:58,813 --> 01:10:00,607
This is one of my hides.
840
01:10:01,199 --> 01:10:03,175

- It's invisible!
- Go in.
841
01:10:03,792 --> 01:10:05,116
Please, go in.
842
01:10:05,903 --> 01:10:08,288

From here,
you can see everything.
843
01:10:28,158 --> 01:10:32,620
I've been talking a lot with Pietro
about how to overcome fear.
844
01:10:33,568 --> 01:10:36,235
Maybe I've got him
to overcome his fear,
845
01:10:40,874 --> 01:10:42,869
but I haven't overcome mine.
846
01:11:01,906 --> 01:11:03,060

Francesca...
847
01:11:03,821 --> 01:11:04,938

Francesca!
848
01:11:10,485 --> 01:11:13,236

What are you doing, Pietro?
Explain to me.
849
01:11:13,336 --> 01:11:15,323
Don't you see?
I'm packing my bag.
850
01:11:15,423 --> 01:11:17,820
What happened?
Why are you angry?
851
01:11:18,017 --> 01:11:19,514
You perfectly know why.
852
01:11:19,614 --> 01:11:23,019

You're an asshole! You've been
fooling me all this time!
853
01:11:25,144 --> 01:11:27,144
I never want to see you again!
854
01:11:58,856 --> 01:11:59,837

Pietro?
855
01:12:06,119 --> 01:12:09,092

- Isn't Pietro with you?
- No, he's gone away.
856
01:12:09,605 --> 01:12:13,065
- Where to?
- I don't know, but that's not the problem.
857
01:12:13,165 --> 01:12:16,133
- Francesca, I need to tell you
something. - Not now.
858
01:12:16,233 --> 01:12:17,905
- Excuse me.
- Wait!
859
01:12:23,141 --> 01:12:24,127
Pietro!
860
01:12:26,596 --> 01:12:27,732

Pietro!
861
01:12:37,390 --> 01:12:38,396

Pietro?
862
01:12:41,517 --> 01:12:42,599

Pietro...
863
01:12:49,891 --> 01:12:51,464

I know you're there.
864
01:12:53,859 --> 01:12:55,375

Don't be childish.
865
01:12:57,221 --> 01:12:59,999

I know why you're hiding.
But you're wrong.
866
01:13:01,929 --> 01:13:04,228
Only those who are
afraid, hide.
867
01:13:06,012 --> 01:13:07,141
Real men,
868
01:13:09,537 --> 01:13:12,507

who are able to see
things as they are,
869
01:13:13,522 --> 01:13:16,874
confront them face to face.
870
01:13:18,001 --> 01:13:20,008

They don't hide in the dark.
871
01:13:25,933 --> 01:13:28,360

See? We've become friends.
872
01:13:34,570 --> 01:13:37,601

And the same has happened
to your mother and me.
873
01:13:37,701 --> 01:13:40,312
But for grown-ups
it's more difficult.
874
01:13:42,546 --> 01:13:46,677
If you're hiding, it means
you're still a little child,
875
01:13:48,423 --> 01:13:50,550
and you'll keep being afraid.
876
01:13:53,235 --> 01:13:54,033

So?
877
01:13:58,460 --> 01:13:59,579

I think...
878
01:14:01,834 --> 01:14:03,742

that you don't understand,
879
01:14:04,622 --> 01:14:06,714

and that you're not my friend.
880
01:14:10,785 --> 01:14:11,958

"<i>Gascoigne.</i>
881
01:14:12,927 --> 01:14:14,267

"<i>McManaman!</i>
882
01:14:15,841 --> 01:14:19,083

"<i>He had no difficulty saving it.
It seemed harder.</i>"
883
01:14:21,040 --> 01:14:23,208
Can you explain to me
what I'm guilty of?
884
01:14:23,400 --> 01:14:25,109
What did I do to you?
885
01:14:25,701 --> 01:14:28,786

You haven't said a word to me
since you got back.
886
01:14:45,042 --> 01:14:46,037
Pietro?
887
01:14:48,873 --> 01:14:50,230

<i>Pietro, open up.</i>
888
01:14:58,200 --> 01:15:00,937

I think I know why
you're angry with me.
889
01:15:03,243 --> 01:15:08,595
Even if I had a relationship with Thomas,
it wouldn't take anything away from you or Dad.
890
01:15:09,393 --> 01:15:12,539
I don't think he'd be happy
if he could see you.
891
01:15:17,838 --> 01:15:19,199
I think he would, instead.
892
01:15:21,757 --> 01:15:24,621

Your father and I loved
each other very much.
893
01:15:25,785 --> 01:15:30,606
I think that, when you really love someone,
you don't want to see him or her unhappy.
894
01:15:35,969 --> 01:15:37,560
I heard from Thomas.
895
01:15:38,374 --> 01:15:41,022

He wants to say goodbye to you
before leaving.
896
01:15:41,496 --> 01:15:43,346
"Leaving"?
Where's he going?
897
01:15:52,960 --> 01:15:54,354
One more "bath"?
898
01:15:57,129 --> 01:16:00,814

My mother said you're leaving.
I've just come to say goodbye.
899
01:16:01,660 --> 01:16:04,847
Are you walking away like that,
without your ball?
900
01:16:05,530 --> 01:16:08,543
Just when you're ready
to play again?
901
01:16:12,483 --> 01:16:13,460
Really?
902
01:16:15,250 --> 01:16:15,785

Yes.
903
01:16:16,860 --> 01:16:19,449

But you have to do
this exercise first.
904
01:16:20,401 --> 01:16:21,790
Or are you too afraid?
905
01:16:37,640 --> 01:16:38,401

Go.
906
01:17:23,514 --> 01:17:25,613

Why are we sitting like this?
907
01:17:26,291 --> 01:17:28,664

Because it helps us
to concentrate.
908
01:17:30,834 --> 01:17:33,374
Look around.
Look at the sky.
909
01:17:39,104 --> 01:17:40,584
I feel like I'm flying.
910
01:17:40,684 --> 01:17:42,142

Shh.
911
01:18:49,775 --> 01:18:50,771

Guys...
912
01:18:55,738 --> 01:18:56,471

Guys...
913
01:19:00,975 --> 01:19:02,083

Guys!
914
01:19:06,630 --> 01:19:11,184

Today we have to wash away the dishonour
of that 11-0 in the first half of the season.
915
01:19:14,546 --> 01:19:16,301
As my colleague Sacchi says,
916
01:19:17,442 --> 01:19:22,334

you have to follow the game plans!
Or do you want to get me fired?
917
01:19:25,700 --> 01:19:27,202
If you lose today,
918
01:19:27,648 --> 01:19:31,207

I won't feel humiliated.
I'll feel disappointed.
919
01:19:33,347 --> 01:19:35,868
Today, you have to form
a wall in midfield.
920
01:19:35,968 --> 01:19:38,715
You have to play to death!
To death!
921
01:19:40,573 --> 01:19:41,371
Trillini,
922
01:19:42,922 --> 01:19:44,232

is your mom here?
923
01:20:15,953 --> 01:20:16,618

Go.
924
01:21:32,775 --> 01:21:34,061

<i>Come on!</i>
925
01:21:36,840 --> 01:21:38,188

Play wide!
926
01:21:40,109 --> 01:21:41,215

Well done, Pietro!
927
01:21:41,500 --> 01:21:44,524

Slide-tackle him!
Cut off his legs!
928
01:21:48,703 --> 01:21:49,392
<i>Ref!</i>
929
01:21:49,797 --> 01:21:50,653

Way to go!
930
01:21:51,735 --> 01:21:53,620

I'm gonna send you
to the hospital.
931
01:21:56,998 --> 01:21:58,198
<i>Go!
Go!</i>
932
01:22:00,939 --> 01:22:02,155
- <i>Go!</i>
- <i>Come on, go!</i>
933
01:22:07,747 --> 01:22:09,299
Do you feel unwell?
934
01:22:10,184 --> 01:22:12,777

- I feel something.
- What do you feel?
935
01:22:14,542 --> 01:22:16,467
I feel we're going to win.
936
01:22:22,062 --> 01:22:22,814

<i>Go!</i>
937
01:22:24,291 --> 01:22:25,249

<i>Go!</i>
938
01:22:25,521 --> 01:22:26,798

Go to the wing!
939
01:22:29,180 --> 01:22:29,809

<i>Go!</i>
940
01:22:30,180 --> 01:22:31,797

<i>Slide-tackle him!</i>
941
01:22:32,123 --> 01:22:32,724

Go!
942
01:22:34,799 --> 01:22:35,672

Goal!
943
01:22:39,756 --> 01:22:41,140

Great!
944
01:22:43,110 --> 01:22:44,063

Great!
945
01:22:47,458 --> 01:22:48,171

Great!
946
01:22:54,530 --> 01:22:55,243

Great!
947
01:23:04,366 --> 01:23:05,537

I'm thirsty!
948
01:23:06,100 --> 01:23:08,457

Come, I'll buy you
an orange soda.
949
01:23:13,540 --> 01:23:15,715
Come on, guys,
we can still win!
950
01:23:15,815 --> 01:23:16,986
Yeah, sure...
951
01:23:17,086 --> 01:23:20,464

You, don't move like a sack of
potatoes, or you'll never catch the ball.
952
01:23:20,564 --> 01:23:23,049
Move like a magpie,
that stays still and then jumps.
953
01:23:23,919 --> 01:23:26,301
- It stays still and then jumps.
- Like... what?!
954
01:23:26,744 --> 01:23:29,685
Like a magpie, that stays still
and then jumps.
955
01:23:29,785 --> 01:23:31,270
It stays still and then jumps.
956
01:23:33,112 --> 01:23:34,532

And you, Mottola...
957
01:23:36,234 --> 01:23:38,215

You have to move like a hawk,
958
01:23:38,403 --> 01:23:40,732

silently and agilely.
959
01:23:47,918 --> 01:23:49,026

It's you!
960
01:23:49,505 --> 01:23:51,346

I thought you had left.
961
01:23:52,113 --> 01:23:54,485

Have you seen how well
Pietro is playing?
962
01:23:55,640 --> 01:23:57,254
He seems confident.
963
01:23:57,354 --> 01:23:59,915

There's still
the second half, though.
964
01:24:00,094 --> 01:24:03,178
I think there won't be
any problem for him, now.
965
01:24:05,300 --> 01:24:07,578
No.
Not for him.
966
01:24:11,406 --> 01:24:12,462
And for us?
967
01:24:14,275 --> 01:24:15,940

Did you say "us"?
968
01:24:19,904 --> 01:24:21,478

Yes.
What about us?
969
01:24:26,845 --> 01:24:27,643
<i>Go!</i>
970
01:24:29,845 --> 01:24:30,634

<i>Go!</i>
971
01:24:31,488 --> 01:24:32,522

<i>Careful!</i>
972
01:24:34,634 --> 01:24:36,314

- <i>Come on!</i>
- <i>Pass the ball!</i>
973
01:24:36,414 --> 01:24:38,779
<i>Offer resistance!</i>
974
01:24:38,836 --> 01:24:39,680

<i>Go!</i>
975
01:24:41,540 --> 01:24:42,320

Cross!
976
01:24:43,601 --> 01:24:44,593

Cross the ball!
977
01:24:46,641 --> 01:24:47,281

Hey!
978
01:24:49,004 --> 01:24:50,882

- <i>Go!</i>
- <i>Knock him down!</i>
979
01:24:51,691 --> 01:24:52,821
<i>Well done!</i>
980
01:24:53,679 --> 01:24:55,217

<i>Come on, stop him!</i>
981
01:24:56,408 --> 01:24:57,558

<i>Ref!</i>
982
01:25:08,316 --> 01:25:09,313

<i>Come on!</i>
983
01:25:11,213 --> 01:25:13,025

- <i>Go!</i>
- <i>Come on!</i>
984
01:25:13,365 --> 01:25:15,271
Knock him down!
Knock him down!
985
01:25:23,613 --> 01:25:24,867
Trip him!
986
01:25:30,922 --> 01:25:31,809

<i>Shoot!</i>
987
01:25:35,505 --> 01:25:36,751

I'm free!
988
01:25:42,958 --> 01:25:44,163

<i>Come on!</i>
989
01:25:48,653 --> 01:25:49,315

<i>Ref!</i>
990
01:25:51,939 --> 01:25:53,507

Penalty for Audace!
991
01:25:56,146 --> 01:26:00,521

<i>Penalty! Penalty! Penalty!</i>
992
01:26:03,708 --> 01:26:04,989

He's limping!
993
01:26:05,507 --> 01:26:08,484

That idiot...
Murderer! Murderer!
994
01:26:08,963 --> 01:26:10,268
<i>You scoundrel!</i>
995
01:26:10,420 --> 01:26:11,571

Fuck off!
996
01:26:13,406 --> 01:26:15,748

That scoundrel kicked you
very hard!
997
01:26:19,105 --> 01:26:21,756
When Pietro was away,
Mottola would shoot penalties.
998
01:26:22,329 --> 01:26:25,407
- Mottola, do you want to shoot it?
- No, I don't feel like it.
999
01:26:25,805 --> 01:26:26,708
Unbelievable!
1000
01:26:29,484 --> 01:26:30,296

Hey,
1001
01:26:30,585 --> 01:26:33,700

does anyone feel like
shooting this darn penalty?
1002
01:26:35,969 --> 01:26:39,349
- I'll shoot it, Coach.
- Are you sure you're up for it?
1003
01:26:41,269 --> 01:26:43,744
- Good thing Pietrino will shoot it.
- That jerk!
1004
01:26:58,303 --> 01:27:00,066
Are you shitting your pants?
1005
01:27:48,210 --> 01:27:49,213

Goal!
1006
01:27:49,675 --> 01:27:50,734

Great!
1007
01:27:51,242 --> 01:27:52,162

Great!
1008
01:28:29,683 --> 01:28:31,046

Well done!
1009
01:28:32,621 --> 01:28:34,778

Well done!
